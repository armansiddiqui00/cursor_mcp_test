# Cursor IDE and MCP Servers

## About Cursor IDE

Cursor is a next-generation code editor designed specifically for AI-assisted development. It leverages large language models to enhance developer productivity through features like:

- **AI Code Completion**: Intelligent code suggestions and completions
- **Code Generation**: Write entire functions or blocks of code through natural language prompts
- **Contextual Understanding**: The AI understands your entire codebase for more relevant assistance
- **Integrated Chat**: Communicate with AI directly within the editor for help with coding tasks
- **Error Explanation**: Get plain language explanations of errors and potential fixes
- **Code Refactoring**: Automatically refactor and optimize code segments
- **Documentation Generation**: Create documentation from existing code

## MCP Servers

MCP (Model Control Protocol) Servers power the AI capabilities in Cursor. These servers:

- Handle the processing of large language models for code completions and generation
- Manage API requests between the Cursor IDE and AI models
- Optimize performance for real-time code assistance
- Securely process code and queries to protect sensitive information
- Support various AI models to provide different capabilities
- Enable enterprise-grade features including workspace synchronization
- Provide scalable infrastructure for AI-assisted development

## Spring AI Integration

Spring AI is a framework that makes it easy to build AI-powered applications in the Spring ecosystem. When used with Cursor IDE and MCP servers, it provides several advantages:

### Key Features of Spring AI

- **Model Integration**: Easily connect to various AI models (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **Prompt Engineering**: Build, test, and maintain prompts with specialized tools
- **Token Management**: Efficient handling of context windows and token limits
- **Embeddings**: Vector database integration for semantic search capabilities
- **Output Parsing**: Structured parsing of AI-generated responses
- **Streaming Responses**: Handle streaming outputs from large language models
- **Observability**: Monitor and track AI interactions for debugging and auditing

### Development Workflow with Spring AI and Cursor

- Use Cursor's AI capabilities to assist in writing Spring AI implementation code
- Test prompts directly within your development environment
- Debug AI responses with integrated tooling
- Get real-time suggestions for optimizing AI interactions
- Receive contextual help for Spring AI APIs and patterns

### Sample Implementation

```java
// Spring AI implementation example with an LLM service
@Service
public class AIAssistantService {
    
    private final ChatClient chatClient;
    
    public AIAssistantService(ChatClient chatClient) {
        this.chatClient = chatClient;
    }
    
    public String generateResponse(String prompt) {
        // Create a prompt template
        ChatPromptTemplate promptTemplate = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages(
            List.of(new SystemMessage("You are a helpful assistant."),
                   new UserMessage(prompt))
        );
        
        // Generate a response
        ChatResponse response = chatClient.call(promptTemplate);
        
        return response.getResult().getOutput().getContent();
    }
}
```
