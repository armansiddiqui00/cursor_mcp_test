# Cursor IDE and MCP Servers

## About Cursor IDE

Cursor is a next-generation code editor designed specifically for AI-assisted development. It leverages large language models to enhance developer productivity through features like:

- **AI Code Completion**: Intelligent code suggestions and completions
- **Code Generation**: Write entire functions or blocks of code through natural language prompts
- **Contextual Understanding**: The AI understands your entire codebase for more relevant assistance
- **Integrated Chat**: Communicate with AI directly within the editor for help with coding tasks
- **Error Explanation**: Get plain language explanations of errors and potential fixes
- **Code Refactoring**: Automatically refactor and optimize code segments
- **Documentation Generation**: Create documentation from existing code

## MCP Servers

MCP (Model Control Protocol) Servers power the AI capabilities in Cursor. These servers:

- Handle the processing of large language models for code completions and generation
- Manage API requests between the Cursor IDE and AI models
- Optimize performance for real-time code assistance
- Securely process code and queries to protect sensitive information
- Support various AI models to provide different capabilities
- Enable enterprise-grade features including workspace synchronization
- Provide scalable infrastructure for AI-assisted development
